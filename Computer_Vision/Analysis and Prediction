- Decision tree model has the advantages of low latency, high accuracy and easy deployment for the classification of handwritten alphabets.
- Random Forest model and KNN model have higher accuracy than the Decision Tree model, but they also have much higher prediction time.
- Therefore, the Decision Tree model is the best choice for this task among the other models.
