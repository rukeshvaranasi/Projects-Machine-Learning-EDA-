Recommendations and Conclusion:-
--> As per the above Observations we can conclude that most of the customers are churned because of the charges,
    lack of Tech support, online security, and the dependents for the packages which they are using.
--> So to Bring back the customers we can provide better Tech support, online security, 
    online backups, device protection with better Rates and with some discounts, and welcome back gift coupons so that we could get back the customer base.
--> Payment mode should also be automated as people are less likely to churn in automated payment methods.
--> To attract new customers we can keep some joining Benefits to them like free device protections, welcome coupons, and online backups for new customers.
--> We can ask the Referrals to the Best existing customers, by providing a referral bonus for them or increasing the duration of existing plans.
    As asking for Referrals is the best way to capture more business as compared to the other modes of searching the new customers
